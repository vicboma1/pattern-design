[Adapter / Wrapper pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern)
=================

* The adapter design pattern is used when you want two different classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
  Interfaces may be incompatible but the inner functionality should suit the need.
  The Adapter pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of 
  one class into an interface expected by the clients.
